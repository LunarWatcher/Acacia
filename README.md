Treesitter polyfill for Vim.

Note that I'm currently the only person working on this, with a fairly low chance of ending up with other maintainers (due to a lack of interest in meta development, mostly). There's no guarantees wrt. stability or functionality at this time, nor is there a concrete roadmap for when stuff is scheduled to be done. If you're interested in seeing tree-sitter support in Vim, please consider contributing to something on the [TODO list](https://github.com/LunarWatcher/Acacia/issues/1)
