Treesitter polyfill for Vim.

Note that this is a somewhat ambitious project for me alone, much less when I basically have no idea what I'm doing yet. I have no idea when this might be usable as a result. As a secondary implication of this, I'll be keeping the code private until I've established a connection with treesitter, and can receive data. If you're reading this, that means (woo!) that has happened, and the bare prototype with no side-effects in Vim works.
